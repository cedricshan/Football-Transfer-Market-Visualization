# STATS-401-Final-Project

This is the repository of the STATS 401 Final Project of Group 3 including Xi Chen, Tianshu Feng, and Yuan Shan. Our topic is football transfer market visualization. The `code` folder stores the Python code to scrape our dataset and clean data for visualization. The scraped, raw data is stored in the `data` folder along with a combined version. The `dashboard` folder contains our visualization dashboard as well as essential processed data for our visualization.

The final presentation of our project can be found in detail on the website: https://transfer-market-vis.netlify.app/
